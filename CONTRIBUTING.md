# Contribution guidelines 🔐

**Hello contributors, I want you to stick to the below-listed contribution guidelines. Happy contributing.**

<br/>

- Issues will be assigned on a **First-Come-First-Serve** basis and are applicable only when they have opted through GitHub.
- If a contributor is unable to solve the allotted issue, the issue needs to be passed to other contenders at the discretion of the maintainer/owner.


## General  

- `Fork` the repo to your account.
- `git clone` to clone the repo

- Making a branch is **optional**, else contribute to the main branch of your forked repo.


## After changes : 
- Make sure you do `git pull` to pull the latest version of the code
- `git add .` to stage for commits
- **NOTICE--> message will be `fix: <anything you fixed>`**
- `git commit -am "fix: Updated Bla Bla Bla"` for committing the code.

  <br/>

- Then create a Pull Request and wait for review.
- Pull request title: **`fix: Bla Bla Bla`**, important to pass the checks.
- Don't forget to attach **`Screenshots, Proper Description and Issue Number`**
- Remember to be respectful to other contributors, mentors, community
- Don't raise invalid/spam issues they will be closed !!
