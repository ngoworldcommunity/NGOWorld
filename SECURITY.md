## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security error please **DONOT** make an issue /discussion out of it, talk about it publicly, instead report it with the most details possible to [Tamal Das](https://twitter.com/tamalCodes). You can expect an update within the next **36 hours** - if not please be patient.

Thankyou. 
Team Milan.
